## Commands
This section lists command(s) run by GRIDSS workflow

GRIDSS is a module software suite containing tools useful for the detection of 
genomic rearrangements. GRIDSS includes a genome-wide break-end assembler, as 
well as a structural variation caller for Illumina sequencing data. GRIDSS 
calls variants based on alignment-guided positional de Bruijn graph genome-wide
break-end assembly, split read, and read pair evidence.

GRIDSS makes extensive use of the standard tags defined by SAM specifications. 
Due to the modular design, any step (such as split read identification) can be
replaced by another implementation that also outputs using the standard tags. 
It is hoped that GRIDSS can serve as an exemplar modular structural variant 
pipeline designed for interoperability with other tools.
